I've been a software engineer for over a decade at this point, and I've always seen peers of mine approach software as something that you just "get better at" or they stick to a small set of design philosophies. I think the better approach is to take a step back and look at the philosophy of code.

What principals should guide us? What can we generalize from patterns?

# DRY

This one is simple: "Don't Repeat Yourself".

# KISS

Keep it Simple, Stupid (pardon my insult)

# SOLID

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID>

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## Open–Closed Principle (OCP)

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

# Building on Single Responsibility Principle, DECOUPLE

# Compose(Compose(Compose))

Also known as CRP (Composite Reuse Principle) 

# Take advantage of your Types and Systems

# Iterators

#
